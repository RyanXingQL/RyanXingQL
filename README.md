### Hi there, I'm Qunliang Xing! ðŸ‘‹ 

<!--
**RyanXingQL/RyanXingQL** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image/video enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

Official repositories:

- :grin: [RBQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/RBQE): Enhancing compressed images blindly and efficiently using an early-exit network plus an IQA module (ECCV 2020).
- :sunglasses: [MFQEv2](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0): Enhancing frames in compressed videos taking advantage of neighboring good-quality frames (TPAMI 2019).

My implementations:

- :satisfied: [PowerQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PowerQE): An unified framework of quality enhancement approaches for compressed images/videos based on PyTorch.
- :grinning: [STDF](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/STDF-PyTorch): Enhancing compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation (AAAI 2020).
- :yum: [ESRGAN](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/SubjectiveQE-ESRGAN): Enhancing the perceptual quality of compressed images using ESRGAN (ECCVW 2018).
- :relaxed: [Image quality assessment toolbox](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/Image-Quality-Assessment-Toolbox): PSNR, SSIM, PI, NIQE, MA, LPIPS, FID, etc.
- :heart_eyes: [Python toolbox](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PythonUtils): IO, data format conversion, metrics, loss functions, deep learning, etc.
