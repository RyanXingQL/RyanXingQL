I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image restoration/enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

Official repositories:

- :star2: [RBQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/RBQE): Enhancing compressed images blindly and efficiently using an early-exit network plus an IQA module (ECCV 2020)
- :star2: [MFQEv2](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0): Enhancing frames in compressed videos taking advantage of neighboring good-quality frames (TPAMI 2019)

My implementations:

- :fire: [STDF](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/STDF-PyTorch): Enhancing compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation (AAAI 2020)
- :fire: [ESRGAN](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/SubjectiveQE-ESRGAN): Enhancing subjective quality of compressed images using ESRGAN (ECCVW 2018)
